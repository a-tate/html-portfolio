<h1>Adam's Coolest Fuckin Movies Ever</h1>
<h2>My favorite 3 movies ever.... and why!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Tombstone</h3>
<p>Because you just can't beat OG cowboys killin' OG bad guys. The world used to be a simpler place</p>

<h3>In Bruges</h3>
<p>The funniest dialogue in any movie ever and an accurate take on being human at the same time</p>

<h3>Boondock Saints</h3>
<p>If only vigilantes in real life could clean house like that</p>
